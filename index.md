## Executive summary

## Introduction
Working with a text data could be very insightfull since the text data includes people ideas and thoughts. Unlike pictures and tabular data, text gives an opportunity to understand what is in people minds. The following project and ideas are based on the quotes dataset - Quotebank: A Corpus of Quotations from a Decade of News. This is a corpus of 178M quotations. The content was  extracted from 162 million English news articles published between 2008 and 2020. 

## Data overview

Since it is a news articles, especially in English it would be some features we should take into account. First of all, we decided to identify "sparsity" of the data. 

### AAAF Tips & Tricks
The idea is to somehow drop the tale of the data. Tale is a set of quotes which would be difficult to use to get any insights. In order to clean the data, we assume that each quote is a intersection of idea and a speaker. Then we would like to get rid of "tale" people or "tale" ideas - the set of people and topics with a low number of data points. The goal of this step is to reduce the data sample and to clean the data out of noize.

### Geographical bias 
Initially our idea was to identify trends in social media, that is why we chose N topics and then filter the quotes with the tags. 
Tags was choosen randomly:

`"brexit","drugs","sexism","immigration","islam","ebola","pandemy","terrorism","home violence","meat consumption","vegetarian","feminism","harassment","darknet", "fraud","privacy","climate change","global warming","carbon emission","mental disease", "mental health","burn out",
"burnout"`.

After filering the quotes with these tags we obtain: 

{% include initial_analysis/overall_quotes_distribution.html %}

As a next step we decided to take a look into dataset trough the time. We plotted some of tags occurence trough the time:

{% include initial_analysis/tags_occurence_timeline.html %}

Let's take a more detailed look on this data. On the current step we can already observe some intersting insights about the data we have:
```markdown
1. For all topics we have a dramatic decrease of quotes occcurence during June 2010 and also for January, March, June and November 2016. **As we have very quite big set of tags and significant number of quotes we could conclude that it could be a problem of dataset.** It is important to take into account such a details for the future analysis. 
2. Besides the issues with a couple of periods, the dataset provides as a very clear and reasonable data. 
    2.1. For example we observe very high occurence of the `financial crisis` at the end of 2008 and in the beginning of 2020. These dates correspond to big financial cirsis at USA and COVID pandemy start resepctively.

Moving forward with our analysis we decided to look in details on the `climate change` topic. We build the subset for the next steps including the next three topics: `"climate change", "carbon emission", "global warming"` as all of these topics are related to the `climate change`.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/BetterThanButter/ada_data_story/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/BetterThanButter/ada_data_story/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
